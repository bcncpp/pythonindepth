## SRP

The single responsibility principle (SRP) states that a software component (in general, a class) must have only one responsibility. This means that it is in charge of doing just one concrete thing, and as a consequence of that, we can conclude that **it must only have one reason to change**.

We should only have to update the class if one specific thing in the domain problem changes. If we have to make modifications to a class for different reasons, it means the abstraction is incorrect and that the class has too many responsibilities. This might be an indication that there is at least one abstraction missing: more objects need to be created to address the extra responsibility that's overloading the class in question.

This design principle helps us build more cohesive abstractions—objects that do one thing, and just one thing, well, which follows the Unix philosophy. What we want to avoid in all cases is having objects with multiple responsibilities (often called God objects, because they know too much, or more than they should). These objects group different (mostly unrelated) behaviors, thus making them harder to maintain.

```python
class SystemMonitor:
    def load_activity(self):
        """Get the events from a source, to be processed."""

    def identify_events(self):
        """Parse the source raw data into events (domain objects)."""

    def stream_events(self):
        """Send the parsed events to an external agent."""
```

In the context of object-oriented design, SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility or concern.

In your example, the class SystemMonitor is responsible for three different tasks:

- Loading activity: It fetches raw data from a source.
- Identifying events: It parses the raw data into events (domain objects).
- Streaming events: It sends the parsed events to an external agent.

These are orthogonal responsibilities, meaning they are unrelated concerns that don't need to be handled together in the same class. The violation of SRP here is that SystemMonitor is doing too much. Each of the methods is responsible for a separate task, which introduces multiple reasons for this class to change. For instance:

- If the way you load activity changes (say, the data source changes), you will need to modify this class.
- If the logic for parsing events changes, you will have to modify this class.
- If the way events are streamed changes (perhaps to a different external agent), again, you'd have to modify this class.

Since each of these responsibilities could evolve independently, the class is violating SRP. They orthogonal resposabilities.


## Refactor to Respect SRP

To adhere to SRP, you should refactor this class into multiple classes, each responsible for one task. For example:
```python
class ActivityLoader:
    """Loads raw activity data from a source."""
    def load(self):
        # Logic to load activity data
        pass

class EventIdentifier:
    """Parses raw data into events."""
    def identify(self, raw_data):
        # Logic to convert raw data into events
        pass

class EventStreamer:
    """Streams parsed events to an external agent."""
    def stream(self, events):
        # Logic to send events to an external agent
        pass
```
Benefits of This Refactor:

- Single Responsibility: Each class now has one clear responsibility—loading, identifying, and streaming—making the code easier to maintain and extend.
- Easier to Modify: If any of the tasks (e.g., loading data, identifying events, or streaming events) change, you only need to modify the class responsible for that task.
- Better Reusability: Now, each of these classes can be reused in different contexts where they are needed.
- Improved Testability: Since each class has a clear responsibility, you can test them individually with unit tests, making the system more robust.

By adhering to SRP, you are separating concerns, improving modularity, and making the system easier to understand and maintain.
